## About
I build practical, lab-safe security tools that automate reconnaissance and vulnerability proof-of-concepts. My work focuses on reliable tooling, reproducible tests, and clean documentation â€” the kind you can hand to a security team and use in real assessments.

*Current focus:* PortSniff (GUI recon tool), TraceNet (Metasploit-integrated CLI), and Lua PoCs for web vulnerabilities.

### TraceNet â€” Exploitation Pipeline (Ongoing)  
github.com/yourhandle/TraceNet Â· Python, Metasploit RPC  
CLI tool to automate exploitation workflows, payload orchestration, and basic pivoting for controlled lab use.

### CVE-2021-41773 PoC (Lua)

## How I work
- All exploit-capable code is built and tested *only in isolated lab environments* (Docker / private VMs).  
- Every repo includes README.md, LAB.md (test steps), and SAFETY.md (ethical usage).  
- I write modular code with reproducible examples and basic CI where applicable.

---

## Roadmap (next 6 months)
- Release TraceNet v0.1 with Metasploit RPC integration.  
- Add unit tests & CI to PortSniff core scan engine.  
- Publish a short technical write-up on responsible PoC development for CVE-2021-41773.
